# Timelines  

**Timelines** is a platformer game built using Python and Pygame, created in just over 24 hours during the Counterspell hackathon. This project showcases the story of a wanderer at the end of time, running from the consequences of his own actions, and exploring the collapse of his timeline.  

## Story Premise  

The wanderer is at the edge of existence, driven by guilt and desperation. His actions have caused a catastrophic collapse of his timeline. He hopes that by reaching the end of time, he will cease to exist and thereby undo the damage, restoring the timeline. Through the game, players traverse challenging levels while experiencing fragments of the characterâ€™s thoughts through our second element positioned at the top of the game.

## Features  

- **Platformer Gameplay**: Navigate through a fully functional platformer inspired by classics in the genre.  
- **End of Time Narrative**: A unique story exploring themes of guilt, time, and redemption.
-  **Level Editor**: Easily create and customize your own levels with the built-in level editor, giving players the tools to expand the gameplay experience. 
- **Developed in Record Time**: Built in less than a day, learning Pygame along the way!
