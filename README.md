# Timelines  

**Timelines** is a platformer game built using Python and Pygame, created in just over 24 hours during the Counterspell hackathon. This project showcases the story of a wanderer at the end of time, running from the consequences of his own actions, and exploring the collapse of his timeline.  

## Story Premise  

The wanderer is at the edge of existence, driven by guilt and desperation. His actions have caused a catastrophic collapse of his timeline. He hopes that by reaching the end of time, he will cease to exist and thereby undo the damage, restoring the timeline. Through the game, players traverse challenging levels while experiencing fragments of the character’s thoughts, although the second interactive element showcasing his internal dialogue wasn't fully implemented due to time constraints.  

## Features  

- **Platformer Gameplay**: Navigate through a fully functional platformer inspired by classics in the genre.  
- **End of Time Narrative**: A unique story exploring themes of guilt, time, and redemption.  
- **Developed in Record Time**: Built in just over a day, learning Pygame along the way!  

## Installation  

To play **Timelines**, follow these steps:  

1. **Download the Repo**
2. **Install Dependencies**
  ensure you have Python 3 installed, then run:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
3. **Run the Game**  
## Known Issues

- The interactive second window showcasing the character’s thoughts is not yet functional.
- There may be occasional bugs due to the rapid development process during the hackathon.

## Development

This project was a team effort created in the spirit of learning and exploration. While the initial idea included two interactive windows (the platformer and a thoughts window), merging work and meeting deadlines proved challenging. Nevertheless, we’re proud to present the playable platformer, which marks our first foray into game development with Pygame.
